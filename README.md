# 4.-Sherlock_And_GCD
Sherlock is stuck while solving a problem: Given an array A={a1,a2, . . . an}, he wants to know if there exists a subset  of this array which follows these statements:
B is a non-empty subset.
There exists no integer x(x>1) which divides all elements of B.
There are no elements of B which are equal to another.

Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer T, , representing the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer, N, representing the size of array A. In the second line there are N space-separated integers, a1, a2, . . . an, representing the elements of array A.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^5 ∀1 ≤ i ≤ N 

Output Format
Print YES if such a subset exists; otherwise, print NO.
